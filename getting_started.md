## Setting up ArcGIS PRO

To follow along during the workshop, you will want to ensure that you have access to ArcGIS Pro before the start of the session. As a reminder, we are only able to facilitate access to ArcGIS Pro for UNC-Chapel Hill affiliates. For some participants your academic institution (if applicable) may be able to facilitate access. For all others, 21-day free trials are available through ESRI here: https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/trial. Individual licenses for ArcGIS Pro (currently 100 USD/year until December 31, 2020) are available as well: https://www.esri.com/en-us/arcgis/products/arcgis-pro/buy.  

 

For UNC-Chapel Hill staff, students, or faculty members, ArcGIS Pro can be accessed in one of two ways. Instructions for both can be found on our GIS Software Guide: https://guides.lib.unc.edu/software/software  

(1) Download ArcGIS Pro to your machine

First, check that your machine meets the hardware requirements: https://pro.arcgis.com/en/pro-app/get-started/arcgis-pro-system-requirements.htm  

Instructions for download can be found on the GIS Software Guide, under the box titled “Licensed GIS Software”

(2) Access ArcGIS Pro using the Virtual Lab

This option is recommended for participants who will be attending the workshop on a mac or other machine that doesn’t meet the hardware requirements.

To connect through the VL, follow the instructions on the GIS Software Guide, on the pages titled “Accessing GIS Software Remotely on a Mac” and “Processing GIS Software Remotely on a PC”

You may notice that these pages have instructions for accessing ArcGIS Pro on the virtual computing lab and the virtual lab. We strongly suggest participants use the virtual lab.

 

If anyone has questions about accessing ArcGIS Pro for the workshop, please let me know.
